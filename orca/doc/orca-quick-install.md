# Installing ORCA

This is a **quick installation** guide. If you experiment any problems, please read the [detailed installation guide](orca-install.md). ORCA has been developed and tested in GNU/Linux systems and ported to Windows. It works in Mac using GNU compilers. It has been tested in MATLAB R2009a-R2017b and Octave >4.0.

## Installation requirements

In order to use ORCA you need:

* GNU `gcc` and `g++`
* MATLAB/Octave (Octave >= 4.0), including `mex`.
  * MATLAB toolboxes: Statistics and Machine Learning
  * Octave packages: statistics,optim,liboctave-dev. These can be easily installed with `pkg install -forge optim` and so on. Depending on your GNU/Linux distribution you may also have to install `liboctave-dev` with your distribution package manager.

## Download ORCA

To download ORCA you can simply clone this GitHub repository by using the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ayrna/orca
```
All the contents of the repository can also be downloaded from the GitHub site by using the "Download ZIP" button.

## Binaries

We provide binary files for several platforms (Debian based and CentOS GNU/Linux and Windows). The compressed files include the git files, so git pull should work. Binaries can be downloaded in the [release page](https://github.com/ayrna/orca/releases). 

## Compilation of `mex` files

ORCA is programmed in MATLAB, but many of the classification algorithms are implemented in C/C++. Because of this, these methods have to be compiled and/or packaged into the corresponding `mex` files.

In Windows and GNU/Linux, you can build ORCA directly from the MATLAB/Octave console. Just enter in the `scr` directory and type `make`.
```MATLAB
>> cd src/Algorithms
>> make
```
After building, you can clean the objects files with `make clean`:
```MATLAB
>> make clean
```

## Installation testing

We provide a set of basic tests to for checking that all the algorithms work, both using ORCA's API and experiment scripts (see [tutorial](orca-tutorial.md) for more information).

The way to run the tests checking the API (see [single test scripts](../src/tests/singletests/)) is the following (running time is ~12 seconds):

```MATLAB
>> cd src/
>> runtestssingle
...

All tests ended successfully
```

To run the tests checking the experiment scripts (running time is ~123 seconds):

```MATLAB
>> cd src/
>> runtestscv
...

If any of these tests fail, please read the [detailed installation guide](orca-install.md).
