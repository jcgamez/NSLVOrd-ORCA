 *  are two cases for an optional function:
 *   -# It is declared as an interface; Some child classes may implement
 *      it but others may not. This macro should be called in the interface
 *      class. See NNLayer::train for an example.
 *   -# It is defined and implemented but may be inappropriate for some
 *      child classes. To prevent misuse of this function, use this macro
 *      to redefine it in those child classes.
 *
 *  This macro will stop the program with a ``function undefined" error.
 *
 *  @note This approach differs from defining functions as pure virtual,
 *  since using the latter way, a child class cannot be instantiated without
 *  implementing all pure virtual functions, while some of them may not
 *  be desired.
 *
 *  @todo A better macro name; Auto-extraction of function name (could be
 *  done by __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ but is not compatible between compilers)
