/** @brief Aggregate hypotheses in a cascade (sequential) way.
 *
 *  For classification problems, aggregating of hypotheses can be
 *  done in a cascade way. That is, a list of classifiers are trained
 *  from the training data; an unknown input is first classified
 *  using the first hypothesis in the list. If the first hypothesis
 *  cannot decide the classification with high reliability, the input
 *  is fed into the next one and so on. (See Cascade::operator() for
 *  details.) We can have as many hypotheses as the problem demands.
 *
 *  The ``reliability'' of a decision is usually determined by a
 *  concept named @em margin. There exist different definitions in
 *  literature, such as @f$yf(x)@f$ in %AdaBoost,
 *  @f$y(w\cdot x-t)/|w|@f$ in SVM. Despite of the differences in
 *  definitions, higher margins usually implicit more robustness to
 *  input disturbance and thus better generalization.
 *
 *  When margin is used in cascade to decide whether to go on to the
 *  next hypothesis, the real output @a y is unknown. A natual
 *  alternative is to use the ``sign'' part of the margin, i.e.,
 *  @f$f(x)@f$ in %AdaBoost and @f$(w\cdot x-t)/|w|@f$ in SVM, and
 *  take the magnitude as the margin. Similar concepts, such as
 *  belief in belief propagation and log-likelihood in coding, can
 *  also be used.
 *
 *  We use the name ``belief'' in this class for binary-class problems.
 *  Very positive and very negative beliefs indicate strong confidence
 *  in the predicting and thus high reliability.
 *
 *  @todo General definition of margin; More explanation of Cascade
