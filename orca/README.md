# ORCA
ORCA (Ordinal Regression and Classification Algorithms) is a MATLAB framework that implements and integrates a wide range of ordinal regression methods and performance metrics from the paper ["Ordinal regression methods: survey and experimental study"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2015.2457911) published in *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*. ORCA also helps to accelerate classifier experimental comparison with automatic fold execution, experiment paralellisation and performance reports. A basic definition of ordinal regression can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_regression).

As a generic experimental framework, its two main objectives are:

1. To run experiments easily to facilitate the comparison between **algorithms** and **datasets**.
2. To provide an easy way of including new algorithms into the framework by simply defining the training and test methods and the hyperparameters of the algorithms.

To help these purposes, ORCA is mainly used through **[configuration files](doc/orca-tutorial.md#launch-experiments-through-ini-files)** that describe experiments, but the methods can also be easily used through a common **[API](doc/orca-tutorial.md#running-algorithms-with-orca-api)**.

## Ordinal regression algorithms

  - [SVR](src/Algorithms/SVR.m) [2]: Standard Support Vector Regression with normalised targets (considered as a naïve approach for ordinal regression since equal distances between targets are assumed).
  - [CSSVC](src/Algorithms/CSSVC.m) [1]: Nominal SVM with the OneVsAll decomposition, where absolute costs are included as different weights for the negative class of each decomposition (it is considered as a naïve approach for ordinal regression since equal distances between targets are assumed).
  - [SVMOP](src/Algorithms/SVMOP.m) [3,4]: Binary ordinal decomposition methodology with SVM as base method, it imposes explicit weights over the patterns and uses a probabilistic framework for the prediction.
  - [ELMOP](src/Algorithms/ELMOP.m) [5]: Standard Extreme Learning Machine imposing an ordinal structure in the coding scheme representing the target variable.
  - [POM](src/Algorithms/POM.m) [6]: Extension of the linear binary Logistic Regression methodology to Ordinal Classification by means of Cumulative Link Functions.
  - [SVOREX](src/Algorithms/SVOREX.m) [7]: Ordinal formulation of the SVM paradigm, which computes discriminant parallel hyperplanes for the data and a set of thresholds by imposing explicit constraints in the optimization problem.
  - [SVORIM](src/Algorithms/SVORIM.m) [7]: Ordinal formulation of the SVM paradigm, which computes discriminant parallel hyperplanes for the data and a set of thresholds by imposing implicit constraints in the optimization problem.
  - [SVORLin](src/Algorithms/SVORLin.m) [7]: Linear version of the SVORIM method (considering a linear kernel instead of the Gaussian one) to check how the kernel trick affects the final performance (SVORLin).
  - [KDLOR](src/Algorithms/KDLOR.m) [8]: Reformulation of the well-known Kernel Discriminant Analysis for Ordinal Regression by imposing an order constraint in the projected classes.
  - [NNPOM](src/Algorithms/NNPOM.m) [6,9]: Neural Network based on Proportional Odd Model (NNPOM), implementing a neural network model for ordinal regression. The model has one hidden layer and one output layer with only one neuron but as many thresholds as the number of classes minus one. The standard POM model is applied in this neuron to provide probabilistic outputs.
  - [NNOP](src/Algorithms/NNOP.m) [10]: Neural Network with Ordered Partitions (NNOP), this model considers the OrderedPartitions coding scheme for the labels and a rule for decisions based on the first node whose output is higher than a predefined threshold (T=0.5). The model has one hidden layer and one outputlayer with as many neurons as the number of classes minus one.
  - [REDSVM](src/Algorithms/REDSVM.m) [11]: Augmented Binary Classification framework that solves the Ordinal Regression problem by a single binary model (SVM is applied in this case).
  - [ORBoost](src/Algorithms/ORBoost.m) [12]: This is an ensemble model based on the threshold model structure, where normalised sigmoid functions are used as the base classifier. The *weights* parameter configures whether the All margins versions is used (`weights=true`) or the Left-Right margin is used (`weights=false`).
  - [OPBE](src/Algorithms/OPBE.m) [13]: Ordinal projection-based ensemble (OPBE) based on three-class decompositions, following the ordinal structure. A specific method for fusing the probabilities returned by the different three-class classifiers is implemented (product combiner, logit function and equal distribution of the probabilities). The base classifier is SVORIM but potentially any of the methods in ORCA can be setup as base classifier.

## Partial order methods
  - [HPOLD](src/Algorithms/HPOLD.m) [16]: Hierarchical Partial Order Label Decomposition with linear and non-linear base methods.

## Nominal methods

  - [SVC1V1](src/Algorithms/SVC1V1.m) [1]: Nominal Support Vector Machine using the OneVsOne formulation (considered as a naïve approach for ordinal regression since it ignores the order information).
  - [SVC1VA](src/Algorithms/SVC1VA.m) [1]: Nominal Support Vector Machine with the OneVsAll paradigm (considered as a naïve approach for ordinal regression since it ignores the order information).
  - [LIBLINEAR](src/Algorithms/LIBLINEAR.m): Implementation of logistic regression and linear SVM based on [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/).
